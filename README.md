## Features

- On successful submit of the "Customer Support", it will send an email to the email which you've set into `MAIL_TO` environment variable, by default it is set to contact@localhost. The from email will be set to `MAIL_FROM` environment variable, by default it is set to noreply@localhost. This will not send an actual email, but it will log the email output into the `logs/email.log` file, to change this behavior you just have to [configure transport](https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/core-libraries/email.html#configuring-transports) into `config/app.php` file.
